		<p style="text">The team drilled cores from the Blue Hole sinkhole and a nearby lagoon. They found that the ratio of titanium to aluminum changed in the ninth and 10th centuries, a period when the Mayan civilization in the Yucatan Peninsula went into decline. More titanium means that heavier rains were affecting the region, since the runoff from the area's volcanic rock is rich in the element. But from about A.D. 800 to 1000, the ratio between the two elements was much smaller, indicating that there was much less rainfall. "When you have major droughts, you start to get famines and unrest," Droxler said.</p>
